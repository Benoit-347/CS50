"""
In pragramming there are different paradimes/ ways of solving problems
Various programming languages have different capabilities
C -> fully combined, compiled to machine code, with data segment and code segment and intense register usage. Very low level. (Also compiler level opmization available)
Java -> fundementally object oriented, uses bytecode with JVM tho (similar to py)  Java uses direct primitive data types, like int, making it fast access unlike Objs everything in py. Java uses direct machine code for operations when possible, especially at runtime, for hotspots. Java uses static typing
python -> very flexible
using classes is a form of data storage property;
used for like how artifacts have artifact_name, sub_stats, sub_stats have 3/4 sub_stat which each have name and roll_value

# Different ways programming is done: 
    # procedural- excute statements one after another, top to bottom (sequencial program)
    # functional- use functions to make programming from endpoints; (modular program) (the fn call, to fn body)
    # classes-
