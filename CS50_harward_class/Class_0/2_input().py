#what is return?

#by taking instructions you can do operations, but to hand gack a product after operations is called return
#not to be confused to changes made to existing data

#manually entering values into prgram is problem? Enter values through terminal?
#use Input

a = input("enter the input 1") #input fn returns the data you put in the terminal
#the variable takes the data you put in the terminal


# doing operations in str
name = input("enter the input 1, the data should be put along with print")
# note: the spaces registers to give the ouput as spaces in the strings
print("printed1" + name)
